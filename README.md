# MLflow--Databricks
This repositry stores basic MLflow codes that were run on Databricks

#### 1. Notebook MLflow - Basic.ipynb displays the basic codes run on Databricks. Please create your own experiment or run MLflow experiments or use the default Databricks Experirments or if you have an Experiment Id, you can use that to make your logs for every experiments that you do.

#### 2. MLflow.dbc - This is the complete .dbc file with MLflow & hyperopt library to tune hyperparameters. I have created a directory to import a function ("Hello World") to show real time code functions.
  ##### - Go to community version databricks or Azure databricks ---> Workspace ---> Create folder ---> Import through file (.dbc)
